# ML Reproducibility Challenge (MLRC)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our participation in the ML Reproducibility Challenge! This challenge is an opportunity to validate and reproduce significant machine learning research, fostering a culture of rigorous scientific investigation and transparency.

## About the Challenge

The ML Reproducibility Challenge is an initiative that invites researchers and enthusiasts to replicate findings from influential papers in the field of machine learning. Our goal is to ensure that scientific results are reliable and reproducible, contributing to the advancement of the field.

## Target Paper

Our team is working on reproducing the results of the following paper:

**TIES-MERGING:** [Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01708)

We chose this paper due to its novel approach and significant contributions to the field of machine learning. Our replication efforts will focus on verifying the results and exploring the robustness of the methodologies used.
